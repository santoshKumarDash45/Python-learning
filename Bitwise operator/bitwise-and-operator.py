# Bitwise and operator can be applied to only int and bool type

print(10 & 20) 

# Answer will be 0

# print(10.5 & 20.6)

# Type error because both are float 

# print('durge' & 'soft')

# Type error because both are string values

print(4 & 5)

# Answer is 4 as if both bits are 1 then result is 1 or else 0

print(4 | 5)

# Answer is 5 as if atleast one bit is 1 then result is 1 or else 0

print(4 ^ 5) 

# Answer is 1 as if both bits are different then result is 1 or else 0
